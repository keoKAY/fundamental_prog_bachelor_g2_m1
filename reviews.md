## NOTE for review of lesson 2 

- Programming fundamental concepts 
- Breakdown the main functions 




#include : 
using namespace 
- int main 
- return 0; 


statement; 
block of code ; {}


- variable vs datatype 

`syntax: datatype name; `
- variable: named memory location used to store the data temporarily!

How to store data permantly: 
- files 
- database

`datatype`: type of data 

short, int , long 
float , double 
char , string 
boolean 
unsigned 

- sizeof(variable) -> calclate size of memory consume 


- naming variables 
    - can't start number 
    - can't use keyword 
    - can't with other symbol beside _ 
    - can't use with whitespace

3. Operators and Expressions 


a. What is operators ? 
- Keyword or symbol used to perform specific operations ( calculations , ... )

```bash
a + b 
a,b -> operand 
+ -> operators 
```
a.1 Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,%)
- % modulo: used to get the remainder
